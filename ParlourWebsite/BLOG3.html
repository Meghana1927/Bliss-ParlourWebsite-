                            Foil highlights are one of the most loved methods used by hair stylists at home. In this method, a stripe of aluminium foil covers the highlighted hair strands, which helps trap the heat and process colour faster. Also, it makes sure that your hair colour will not drip onto the surrounding area and you will get a precise result.
